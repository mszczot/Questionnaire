		Thank you for completing our questionnaire.<br><br>
This study aims to find a relationship between vegetarianism, executive

functions, and healthy choices. The three tasks you completed were:<br>
<ul>
	<li>the Stroop task - which tests for inhibitory control,</li>
	<li>the N-back task – which tests for working memory, and</li>
	<li>a Cognitive Task-Switching task – which tests for cognitive

flexibility</li>
</ul> <br>
Inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility are core

executive functions. Executive functions are important in every aspect of 

life. Studies have shown executive functions have an impact on mental 

health, physical health, quality of life, job/school success, and marital 

harmony (Diamond, 2013).<br><br>
This study hypothesises that vegetarians have better executive functions

and make healthier choices.<br><br>
